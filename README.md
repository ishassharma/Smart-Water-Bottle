# Smart Water Bottle
This project conceptualizes the development of a system that detects and records the quantity and quality of water intake by the user and further uses the data to recommend to the individual the possible required hydration levels that he can attain. The system is connected to the app and gives a reminder based on the recommendation system designed for the particular user to drink water based on the analytics done on the data in the cloud. This system can induce a huge change of dynamics in the overall health of a person.

## Keywords for Technologies/hardware used:
